description: |
  H3 K27M refers to a specific mutation in the histone H3 protein, where lysine at position 27 is replaced by methionine. 
  This mutation is primarily associated with diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), a category of highly aggressive brain tumors that predominantly affect children but can also occur in adults. 
  The mutation is linked to poor prognosis, with median overall survival ranging from 10 to 14 months post-diagnosis.[PMC7739048](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7739048/), [38102230](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38102230/)

    title: Inhibition of PRC2 activity by a gain-of-function H3 mutation found in pediatric glioblastoma
    authors: Peter W Lewis, Manuel M Müller, Matthew S Koletsky, Francisco Cordero, Shu Lin, Laura A Banaszynski, Benjamin A Garcia, Tom W Muir, Oren J Becher, C David Allis
    context: The paper highlights that the **K27M mutation** in histone H3 genes (**H3F3A** and **HIST1H3B**) defines **DIPGs** by reducing H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) through inhibition of **PRC2** activity via the EZH2 subunit. It also notes that similar lysine-to-methionine mutations disrupt methylation, indicating a broader mechanism of epigenetic reprogramming in tumor development.

    title: Reduced H3K27me3 and DNA hypomethylation are major drivers of gene expression in K27M mutant pediatric high-grade gliomas
    authors: Sebastian Bender, Yujie Tang, Anders M Lindroth, Volker Hovestadt, David T W Jones, Marcel Kool, Marc Zapatka, Paul A Northcott, Dominik Sturm, Wei Wang, Bernhard Radlwimmer, Jonas W Højfeldt, Nathalène Truffaux, David Castel, Simone Schubert, Marina Ryzhova, Huriye Seker-Cin, Jan Gronych, Pascal David Johann, Sebastian Stark, Jochen Meyer, Till Milde, Martin Schuhmann, Martin Ebinger, Camelia-Maria Monoranu, Anitha Ponnuswami, Spenser Chen, Chris Jones, Olaf Witt, V Peter Collins, Andreas von Deimling, Nada Jabado, Stephanie Puget, Jacques Grill, Kristian Helin, Andrey Korshunov, Peter Lichter, Michelle Monje, Christoph Plass, Yoon-Jae Cho, Stefan M Pfister
    context: The paper highlights that the **K27M mutation** in histone variant **H3.3** occurs in ~50% of **pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs)** and defines a distinct subgroup with biological and clinical significance. The mutation causes a global reduction of the repressive mark **H3K27me3** by aberrantly recruiting the **PRC2 complex** and inhibiting its enzymatic component **EZH2**. Chromatin and DNA methylation analyses reveal that reduced H3K27me3 levels and DNA hypomethylation together drive gene activation in **K27M mutant pHGGs**.

    title: The histone H3.3K27M mutation in pediatric glioma reprograms H3K27 methylation and gene expression
    authors: Kui-Ming Chan 1, Dong Fang, Haiyun Gan, Rintaro Hashizume, Chuanhe Yu, Mark Schroeder, Nalin Gupta, Sabine Mueller, C David James, Robert Jenkins, Jann Sarkaria, Zhiguo Zhang
    context: The paper highlights that the **K27M mutation** in one allele of the **H3F3A** gene, encoding histone variant **H3.3**, occurs in 60% of high-grade pediatric gliomas and is associated with a median survival of ~1 year. The mutation reduces global **H3K27me2** and **H3K27me3** levels but paradoxically increases their presence, along with **Ezh2**, at hundreds of gene loci in tumor cells. This localized enrichment at gene promoters alters the expression of cancer-related genes, demonstrating that the **H3.3K27M mutation** reprograms the epigenetic landscape and drives tumorigenesis.

    title: A sensitive and specific histopathologic prognostic marker for H3F3A K27M mutant pediatric glioblastomas
    authors: Sriram Venneti, Mariarita Santi, Michelle Madden Felicella, Dmitry Yarilin, Joanna J Phillips, Lisa M Sullivan, Daniel Martinez, Arie Perry, Peter W Lewis, Craig B Thompson, Alexander R Judkins
    context: The paper highlights that the **K27M mutation** in the **H3F3A** gene, encoding histone variant **H3.3**, occurs in ~30% of pediatric glioblastomas (GBM) and ~80% of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG), leading to a global reduction in **H3K27me3**. The study evaluated biomarkers for detecting these tumors, demonstrating that immunohistochemistry targeting the **H3.3 K27M mutation** showed 100% sensitivity and specificity, outperforming global H3K27me3 reduction as a diagnostic biomarker. Tumors positive for **H3.3 K27M** were associated with significantly poorer prognosis, establishing immunohistochemical detection as a reliable method to identify a high-risk subset of pediatric GBM.

    title: H3K27M mutant glioma Disease definition and biological underpinnings
    authors: Amanda M Saratsis 1, Truman Knowles 2, Antonela Petrovic 3, Javad Nazarian
    context: The paper highlights that **high-grade glioma (HGG)** is a leading cause of cancer deaths in children and the most common primary CNS tumor in adults, with pediatric and adult forms being molecularly distinct but sharing certain events like the **H3K27M mutation**. This somatic missense mutation, found in **H3F3A (H3.3)** or **HIST1H3B (H3.1)**, occurs in up to 80% of pediatric diffuse midline gliomas and 60% of adult diffuse gliomas. The **H3K27M mutation** is linked to poorer survival and therapy response compared to **H3 wild-type tumors**. The paper reviews the clinical features and biological mechanisms of H3K27M mutant gliomas, providing a foundation for advancing research and treatment strategies for this aggressive disease.

    context: The paper highlights that **Diffuse midline glioma (DMG), H3 K27M-mutant** is a tumor entity identified in the 2016 WHO classification, characterized by a **K27M mutation** in histone variants **H3.3** or **H3.1**. While this tumor is associated with poor prognosis in children, clinical data in adults are limited. The study collected data on 60 adult patients with **H3 K27M-mutant DMG**, finding tumors in various midline structures like the thalamus, spinal cord, and brainstem. **Genomic profiling** showed mutations exclusively in **H3F3A**, with frequent mutations in **TP53**, **PPM1D**, and others. The overall survival for adults was **27.6 months**, longer than in pediatric cases and **IDH-wildtype glioblastoma**. These findings suggest that H3 K27M-mutant DMG is a heterogeneous disease, with distinct outcomes and molecular profiles in adults compared to children.

    title: H3 K27M-altered glioma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma: Semi-systematic review of treatment landscape and future directions
    authors: Martin van den Bent, Amanda M Saratsis, Marjolein Geurts, Enrico Franceschi
    context: The paper highlights that **H3 K27M-mutant diffuse glioma** is a recently identified, highly aggressive brain tumor classified as a **grade IV glioma** by the **WHO** since 2016, associated with poor prognosis. Despite its recognition as a key diagnostic and prognostic marker, **radiation therapy** remains the sole standard of care, with no effective systemic treatments available. The review discusses treatments for **diffuse midline glioma** and **diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG)** before the identification of the H3 K27M mutation, the current standard of care for **H3 K27M-mutant** gliomas, and **ongoing clinical trials**. Forty-one clinical trials, including those evaluating **H3 K27M vaccination**, **CAR T-cell therapy**, and **small molecule inhibitors**, are currently underway, highlighting the need for further evaluation of novel therapies for this underserved patient population.
