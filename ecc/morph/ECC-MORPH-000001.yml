description: |
    Judah Folkman first discovered the concept of rapid blood vessel growth in 1971, as detailed in his publication in the *New England Journal of Medicine* (NEJM), referenced [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4938153/). 
    His work laid the foundation for further research into angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels. 

evaluation: |
  - "Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of angiogenesis-related markers like CD34, VEGF, FVIII-RA, CD31, Ki-67."
  - "H&E staining"
  - qPCR to measure expression levels of angiopoietins and/or VEGF, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10669954/, https://www.nature.com/articles/3780177
